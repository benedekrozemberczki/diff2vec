Diff2Vec
============================================
<p align="justify">
Diffusion to vector is a transductive topological graph embedding procedure inspired by other sequence based graph embedding procedures. Sequences are generated by a linearized branching process. It is robust to graph densification and growth. The created embeddings are competitive with other sequence based embedding methods (e.g. DeepWalk/Node2Vec). It can be used to learn embeddings of networks with millions of nodes and it allows for parallel processing in the sequence generation and learning phases.

### Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 2.7.

```
tqdm              4.19.5
numpy             1.13.3
pandas            0.20.3
texttable         1.2.1
gensim            3.0.0
scipy             0.19.1
networkx          1.11
joblib            0.11
logging           0.4.9.6  
```

### Datasets

The code takes an input graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. A sample graph for the `Facebook Restaurants` dataset is included in the  `data/` directory.

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/diffusion_2_vec.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.

```
  --input STR                   Path to the edge list csv.                Default is `data/restaurant_edges.csv`
  --output STR                  Path to the embedding features.           Default is `emb/restaurant.out`
  --dimensions INT              Number of embedding dimensions.           Default is 128.
  --vertex-set-cardinality INT  Number of nodes per diffusion tree.       Default is 80.
  --num-diffusions INT          Number of diffusion per source node.      Default is 10.
  --window-size INT             Context size for optimization.            Default is 10.
  --iter INT                    Number of ASGD iterations.                Default is 1.
  --workers INT                 Number of cores.                          Default is 4.
  --alpha FLOAT                 Initial learning rate.                    Default is 0.025.
```

### Examples

The following commands learns a graph embedding and writes it to disk. The first column in the embedding file is the node ID.

Creating an embedding of the default dataset with the default hyperparameter settings.

```
python src/diffusion_2_vec.py
```
Creating an embedding of an other dataset the `Facebook Politicians`.

```
python src/diffusion_2_vec.py --input data/politician_edges.csv --output output/politician.out
```

Creating an embedding of the default dataset in 32 dimensions, 5 sequences per source node with maximal vertex set cardinality of 40.

```
python src/diffusion_2_vec.py --dimensions 32 --num-diffusions 5 --vertex-set-cardinality 40
```
